I am building a Chrome Dino Game using Python, and have leaderboard for it.  

Before start, you need to run the code at "leaderboard" branch.  

After a game, you may check the leaderboard at the URL.  

Thank you to the source contributor https://github.com/dhhruv/Chrome-Dino-Runner  
If there's any copyright issue, please contact me to remove.  

This code is the Dino application, built using PyGame.  
The PyGame will send the score to the leaderboard via HTTP POST Request.  

To run: 
```
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python chromedino.py
```  

Run the following code to build an exe at "build/" folder.  
```
python setup.py
```
